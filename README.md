# Batch Move Calendar Events

## About
This AppleScript for macOS helps you batch-move calendar events between calendars. You can also filter events by keywords, making it easier to organize your schedule.

## How to Use
1. Open the script in **Script Editor** on macOS. 
2. Customize these values in the script:
   - **Target Calendar**: Replace `"Target Calendar"` with the destination calendar name.
   - **Source Calendars**: Replace `{"Source Calendar 1", "Source Calendar 2"}` with the source calendar names.
   - **Keyword**: Replace `"Keyword"` with the word or phrase you want to filter by.
3. Run the script. ðŸŽ‰

### Important Notes:
- **Calendar Names**: Make sure the calendar names match exactly, including:
  - Uppercase/lowercase letters.
  - Spaces (e.g., `"Work Tasks"` vs `"WorkTasks"`).
  - Emojis: If your calendar name contains emojis, it's best to **manually remove them temporarily** before running the script. After the script completes, you can add the emojis back.
- If the script cannot find a calendar, double-check the spelling and formatting in the **Calendar app**.
